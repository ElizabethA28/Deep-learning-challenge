Overview 

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. 

Results
To begin the data processing we removed any irrelevant information. After dropping EIN and
NAME the remaining columns were to be considered features for the model. Name was added
back into the second test for binning purposes. The data was then split for training and testing
sets. The target variable for the model was labeled “IS_SUCCESSFUL” and has the value of 1
for yes and 0 for no. APPLICATION data was analyzed and “CLASSIFICATION value was used
for binning. We used several data points as a cutoff to bin “rare” variables together with the new
value of “Other” for each unique value. Categorical variables were encoded by get_dummies()
after checking to see if the binning was successful.
Three layers were selected in total after applying neutral networks. 

Overall, deep learning models should have multiple layers, since its machine based it teaches the computer to filter the layers.
